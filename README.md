Quick Usage
format your 4d-stem data (gatan dm4 and/or py4dstem formatted h5 accepted) in accordance with the example input directory. 
Then place a Diffraction_SI.dm4 or dp.h5 in each folder. 
You can then run the code from the driver script "main.py" which will guide you through the analysis workflow, asking for user input when needed.
All processed data and images will be saved in the corresponding data/Material_Name/dsN directories (where N is the dataset number).
