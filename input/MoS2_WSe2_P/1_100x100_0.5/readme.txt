This is an example directory for a P MoS2/WSe2 sample with a scan size of 100x100 pixels which are 0.5 nm wide.
The prefix of 1_ means that this dataset will be refered to as dataset 1 in processed data and analysis.

To run the code please put a "Diffraction_SI.dm4" gatan file here (softlink will not work at the moment)
or a py4dstem formatted h5 file called "dp.h5". Running "main.py" in the src directory will then guide you through the analysis.
